Project for an AI subject from 2019/20 on the Master's Degree on Intelligent Systems.

## What is it about?
It's basically a simulator where various __autonomous vehicles__, controlled by a __main agent__, take care of fires in a **N by N** world. Please read the report for more info, and apologize by advance for it being in my native language (Portuguese).

It uses an external library called *JADE*. For more info about it click [here](https://jade.tilab.com/).

To run, simply compile and execute the MainContainer.
