# AI-19-20

Project for an AI discipline from 2019/20.

## What is it about?
It's basically a simulator where various __autonomous vehicles__, controlled by a __main agent__, take care of fires in a **N by N** world. Please read the report for more info, and apologize by advance for it being in my native language (Portuguese).

To run, simply compile and execute the MainContainer.
